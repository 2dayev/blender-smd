== 0.8 - September 30th, 2010 ==

General:

  * Cross-platform compatibility
  * Support addon unloading properly
  * Moved "Target Up Axis" property from armature to scene, as it can affect meshes too. Models targeting different up axes will have to be in different scenes from now on.

Import:

  * Optimised animation import
  * Fixed standalone animation import
  * Preserve material name if too long for Blender
  * Fixed animation import when a bone's parent wasn't in the armature
  * Fixed "smd_bone_vis" error when importing subsequent meshes
  * Do not resize etc. bones if there is only one in the armature (static props)
  * Scale 3D View to show imported mesh as well as armature (static props)
  * Gave up trying to reduce the number of animations keyframes imported due to bone "wobble". Like motion capture data, SMD anims will just have to be re-created before being edited.

Exporter:

  * Support all modifiers
  * Support sharp edges
  * Fixed Y-up animation export
  * Start exporting animation from the first defined keyframe, not scene frame zero (consistent with not finishing on the last scene frame)
  * Prevented errors when exporting hidden objects
  * Error when trying to export to a relative file path when the .blend hasn't been saved (otherwise it ends up somewhere weird)

== 0.7 - August 30th, 2010 ==

General:

  * Upgraded to Blender 2.54 beta. The script can no longer be used with 2.53 beta.


Importer:

  * Animation import (EasyPickins)
  * Fixed VTA import regression
  * Made bone length calculation more robust
  * Do not connect bones unless model is Z-up (temporary fix, I hope)
  * Do not generate a warning on $animation name redefinition

Exporter:

  * Mostly fixed animation export when imported bones are not Z-up. Configure target bone up axis from the Armature Properties panel.

== 0.6.5 - August 30th, 2010 ==

Importer:

  * Extend 3D View's gridlines and far clip distance to match import's size
  * Added support for absolute paths in QCs

== 0.6.4 - August 28th, 2010 ==

General:

  * Removed BigLines from the credits, at his request

Importer:

  * Improved performance by 30%
  * Fixed exception if a vertex is found weighted to a nonexistent bone
  * Fixed exception when exporting meshes without parents
  * Fixed exception at the very end of the import process if it wasn't invoked from the 3D View
  * Fixed new armatures sometimes being named after earlier QC imports

== 0.6.3 - August 28th, 2010 ==

Exporter:

  * Fixed not exporting reference bone positions (whoops)
  * Fixed subfolder creation failing when the scene root doesn't exist

== 0.6.2 - August 27th, 2010 ==

Importer:

  * Fixed bones with siblings being collapsed into each other by the bone connection routine
  * Fixed occasional errors when choosing armature for additional meshes
  * Fixed bones becoming connected to children directly below them, as well as above (hotfix)

== 0.6.1 - August 27th, 2010 ==

General:

  * Optimisations
  * More descriptive messages on fatal errors; check the console

Importer:

  * Fixed bones with siblings not always being conncted properly
  * Changed the armature search method when importing additional meshes:
   # Active armature
   # First armature in the selection
   # First armature found modifying something in the selection
   # First armature in the scene
   # Otherwise a new armature is created
  * Bones at the end of chains are now ALWAYS spheres (fixes length issues and direction confusion)

Exporter:

  * Fixed export failing if there is no active object
  * Fixed exporter trying to write frames out even if there was no animation on an armature
  * Don't carry on trying to compile a QC if studiomdl isn't found
  * Warn when exceeding Source's bone limit of 128

== 0.6 - August 26, 2010 ==

Importer:

  * *Bones are now imported correctly to their rest positions*
  * *Meshes now import three times faster*
  * Changed the bone connection options. You can now choose to:
   * Connect all bones regardless of compatibility with other SMDs
   * Connect only bones that can be connected without breaking compatibility
   * Connect no bones at all
  * Unconnected bones become spheres without tails, to better represent SMD bones
  * Up axis is now adhered to when importing QCs, and can be configured when importing lone SMDs
  * Optimised QC line parsing


Exporter:

  * *Fixed bone export (thanks to EasyPickins)*, under all bone rotations modes
  * *Object scale and rotation is now applied* to all exports (Translation is only applied to meshes with parents or armature modifiers)
  * Copy meshes when converting between quads and tris, instead of operating on the original (EasyPickins)
  * Added option to compile a QC file automatically on export
  * Added armature configuration panel:
   * Actions for batch export can be filtered by name
   * The active action can be changed, and new ones created
