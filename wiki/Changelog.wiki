Importer:

  * *Bones are now imported correctly to their rest positions*
  * *Meshes now import three times faster*
  * Changed the bone connection options. You can now choose to:
   * Connect all bones regardless of compatibility with other SMDs
   * Connect only bones that can be connected without breaking compatibility
   * Connect no bones at all.
  * Unconnected bones become spheres without tails, to better represent SMD bones
  * Up axis is now adhered to when importing QCs, and can be configured when importing lone SMDs
  * Optimised QC line parsing


Exporter:

  * *Fixed bone export (EasyPickins)*, under all bone rotations modes
  * *Object scale and rotation is now applied* to all exports (Translation is only applied to meshes with parents or armature modifiers)
  * Copy meshes when converting between quads and tris, instead of operating on the original (EasyPickins)
  * Added option to compile a QC file automatically on export
  * Added armature configuration panel:
   * Actions for batch export can be filtered by name
   * The active action can be changed, and new ones created
